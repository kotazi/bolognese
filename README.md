# Bolognese

Bolognese is the simplest HTML5 Editor.

## Getting Started

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Bolognese Sample</title>
    <script src="./../dist/js/bolognese.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Bolognese Sample</h1>
    <div id="bolognese"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
